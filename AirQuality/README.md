# Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality

This hourly data set considers 6 main air pollutants and 6 relevant meteorological variables at multiple sites in Beijing.

## Dataset Information
Additional Information:
This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.
